                    <h3>Selection</h3>
                    ALL of our drivers are at least 25 years old and have a minimum of three years
                    driving experience. Each must have a clear MVR for the last two years and pass
                    a comprehensive physical exam, including a lower back examination. All must
                    pass a drug-screen test, a road test under "real-driving" conditions and submit
                    references of past employment. Finally, all must submit to a comprehensive
                    background check.

                    <h3>Training</h3>
                    All of our drivers are first and foremost safe drivers. We don't employ unsafe
                    drivers. We discuss safety, we promote safety, we demand and reward safety.
                    </p>

                    <p align="left">Our drivers are also trained in..."The Customer is
                        Always Right"&nbsp;Program which includes the following:</p>
                    <ul style="text-align:left;">
                        <li>Proper conduct when interfacing with Shipper's employees
                            and customers.</li>
                        <li>Proper handling of Shipper's merchandise.</li>
                        <li>Proper preparation of Shipper's documents.</li>
                        <li>Completion of daily "Activity Reports".</li>
                        <li>Strict compliance with all Safety and Soundness Rules and
                            Regulations.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Compensation</h3>
                    Black Horse Carriers drivers are highly compensated and receive valuable
                    benefits. This approach produces almost no driver turnover, which in turn,
                    produces lower overhead costs, reduced insurance expenses, fewer accidents,
                    faster and more effective startups, high-quality substitute and extra drivers,
                    and drivers who always display a more pleasant and positive attitude about
                    themselves and their jobsâ€¦our approach yields a superior service by every
                    measure.
