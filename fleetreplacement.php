                        Our contract carriage mission is to replace private truck fleets, of
                        any size, for companies whose business requires specialized trucks

                    <p>
                        We can replace a private fleet, or under-performing dedicated fleet
                        with a transportation system that enhances and promotes the specialized
                        functions that made the private truck fleet an absolute necessity in
                        the first place; and, we absolutely execute these specialized functions
                        efficiently and dependently so that your needs are met and your goals
                        are achieved.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We have broad transportation experience across many industries.<br>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We are driven to enhance productivity through the best systems,
                        technology, schedules and equipment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We design our transportation models around the flexible use of
                        resources, allowing us to adjust fleet sizes and manpower to the
                        ever-changing needs of our customers, eliminating rigid fleet sizes and
                        significant fixed costs for resources that are not always required.
