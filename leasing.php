					Typically, long and short-term driver leasing services---recruit licensed
					drivers from the general population of unemployed, or underemployed drivers
					and, attempt to match them up with potential customers, often with just an
					interview and a geographical match.
					</p>

					<p>
						Black Horse Carriers actually operates a fleet of trucks, and employs dispatchers and drivers operating in actual commercial driving environments.&nbsp; Black Horse Carriers provides:&nbsp; direct access to an "operating" driver pool that has less than 5% turnover.&nbsp; Our Driver Lease customers get experienced drivers that 'stay-put'; drivers are cross-trained so that Driver Lease Customers always have back-up drivers that are ready to go.&nbsp; Our Operations and Safety Departments (responsible for keeping Black Horse in safety compliance as a for-hire motor carrier) are readily available to assist our Driver Lease Customers in the critical area of Private Carrier Safety Compliance.
					</p>


					<p>
					<h3>A Black Horse Driver Lease is an Investment in Safety.</h3>
					</p>

					<p>
						Since Black Horse is a major fleet operator our own survival demands the following:
					</p>


					<p align="center">Hire only the <b>best</b> drivers.<br/>
						Always reinforce our drivers <b>good safety</b> instincts.<br/>
						Reward drivers who are <b>accident-free</b>.</p>

					<h3>As a motor carrier we are rated for safety by the government and the insurance industry.</h3>

					<p>
								The element of safety is critical. Since <b>BLACK HORSE</b> is a major
								fleet operator our own survival demands that we constantly strive to hire
								only the best drivers, always reinforce our drivers’ good safety
								instincts with ongoing safety training, and always reward drivers who are
								accident-free.&nbsp;
                    </p>

						
								<p>As a motor carrier we are rated for safety by the government and the 
                                    insurance industry. We must have a good safety record to remain viable, and the standards we use provide a 
                                    direct safety benefit to our Driver Lease Customers, such as:</p>

								<ol>
									<li>Fewer Accidents</li>
									<li>Fewer Cargo Losses and More Professional Cargo Handling</li>
									<li>Less Vehicle Damage from Abuse and Mishandling</li>
									<li>A More Professional Public Image</li>
								</ol>

						
								<p>
									When done correctly driver leasing is much more than providing payroll
									tax services, employee benefits and worker compensation insurance. It’s
									really about providing operational continuity to your private fleet,
									safely and efficiently, and that’s <b>THE DIFFERENCE.</b>
